# NewerSMBW Music Challenge Generator
Actually, it's an editor, not a generator :p

A simple tool to preview and edit NewerSMBW's Music Houses's musics from the game's source code.

# Usage
Build the code by yourself using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or download the latest [Compiled Binary](https://github.com/RedStoneMatt/NewerSMBW-Music-Challenge-Generator/releases) and open the software.

Now you can either start playing with the noteblocks by clicking them, or you can open the file that contains the Music Houses's musics as follows:

-First of all, you need to be able to compile [NewerSMBW's source code](https://github.com/Treeki/NewerSMBW/tree/no-translations/Kamek), you can find a tutorial [here](https://horizon.miraheze.org/wiki/Setting_Up_and_Compiling_the_Newer_Sources).

-Then, in the NewerSMBW Music Challenge Generator, click File -> Open and select the [bonusRoom.cpp](https://github.com/Treeki/NewerSMBW/blob/no-translations/Kamek/src/bonusRoom.cpp) file located in the src folder of your NewerSMBW Source code.

-Now that the file is opened, you can start playing and editing the musics by editing the content of the different boxes, it should be intuitive enough for me not to have to explain that :p

-When you're done, click File -> Save or File -> Save As... to save your new bonusRoom.cpp file that contains your edited musics !

-You can now compile your code and put it in your game and admire your new musics !

# Warning
I'm definitely not the best programmer of the world, so there can be errors like crashes, so save your file often !
